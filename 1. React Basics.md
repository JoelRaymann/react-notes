## Component

Component is a property of React which has a set of functionalities that helps us develop a react app. This includes functions like render(). We have many methods with component such as ComponentWillMount() etc.

## The Principle of SPA

With SPA, we communicate to backend only for JSON data using API. We generally communicate back and forth to the backend were only JSON data is the means of communication. With each JSON data, we use it and work with it.

## Life Cycle Methods

- Component comes with some built-in functions called life cycle functions
- Life Cycle methods are methods which are called at different stages of the components render. This includes methods like componentDidMount()(called when component got mounted/rendered), componentWillMount() (called when component is staged for rendering) and so and so. The list is big.

### componentDidMount()

- This method is called after the component is rendered. Any code between this function is run after mounting/rendering the component for the first time.

### App structure

- A react app is a series of components which has more components which call components and so on.
- Each react component is like a custom XML tags and allow funtionalities of HTMLElements.

```jsx
render() {
    return (
        <div class="App">
            <h1>Monster App</h1>
            <SearchBox onSearchChange={this.onSearchChange} />
            <CardList monsters={filteredMonsters} />
        </div>
    )
}
// The CardList and SearchBox is a custom JSX Components used in the App Component
```

- Structuring App is vital for a smooth and less messy project. Remember, we need to consider reusability of code.

### The idea of Component

- We want to break our code into smaller reusable codes and this is called modular programming methodology.
- Each module/component is a self sustaining and standalone component.

### Props

- Props are the argument given to a component when it is used inside another component.
- To put it simple, its the key-value pair of arguments passed to the component when it is used.

```js
<CardList name="Joel" /> // The name = "Joel" is a key-value pair and this is called a single prop.
```

- In the above example, the key-value pair {name: "Joel"} is a single prop. Together with other arguments, the entire props argument is made. This props argument allows us to make a component accept parameter and act upon those parameters.
- One of the main property of props is the children. The children property allows us to access the tags in-between the Component tags

```js
<CardList name="Joel">
  <hi></h1>
</CardList>
```

- the above <h1> tag can be accessed with the props.children properity. This is beneficial as it gives us access to control all the tags within our component tag including another JSX component.

### Prop vs State

- Props are the argument using which we propagate state. State lives with only one component. All child component within the component can receive the prop as argument via props.
- State turns to props as it is passed down the children components. Hence, one way data flow. From top to bottom.

### Synthetic Events

- These Events are special Event Handler that is like a fake event handler like html events.
- These fake event handlers communicate the event results to the React VirtualDOM which transfers the event result to the HTMLDOM.
- Eg of SyntheticEvents include onChange, onHover, onFocus etc. Literally all the HTML events has a synthetic event in react.

### Destructuring

- Destructuring is a process of extracting properties or data from an object and use it to our liking. Syntax:

```js
const { element } = this.state;
```

- now the element property is extracted from the state object. This is handy when we need to work on a copy of a property present in an object.

## Custom Component Methods

- If we want to write our own custom methods within our class component, we can do so as we would do normally provided the function NEVER uses "this" object.
- When we want to setState() and all, which are present in "this" object, we need to BIND the function in the constructor so that the function is created before the object of the component is made.

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      monsters: [],
    };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this); // This binding is necessary to run this without error
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    console.log(this.state.monsters);
  }
}
```

- Now, this is tedious if we have to do it for all functions we define. Luckily, we have a shortcut. See, arrow functions introduced in ES6 has this feature called auto bind on callee.
- Well what this means is that an arrow function automatically binds it to the caller, who in our case would be the "this" object. Hence, we can mitigate this problem.
- This is called LEXICAL SCOPING.

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      monsters: [],
    };
    // no need to bind as lexical scoping includes handleChange to "this" object.
  }

  handleChange = (e) => {
    console.log(this.state.monsters);
  };
}
```

## What did create-react-app did?

- Create App was a biolerplate files that helped us setup a Babel and Webpack to convert the ES6 based JSX files to JS files. But we can develop websites without it too.
- We can use vanilla js to develop our react app. How? Well first we need to import the unpacked version of the react and react-dom.
- Then we use a special method called React.createElement() which takes 3 arguments, 1. The component name, 2. The props argument for the component, 3. The child for the components. Thats all. Its that simple

```js
// Create component Person that takes props name and occupation.
const Person = (props) => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, props.name),
    React.createElement("p", {}, props.occupation),
  ]);
};

// Create component App
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "React is rendered!!"),
    React.createElement(Person, { name: "Joel", occupation: "CSE Student" }),
    React.createElement(Person, { name: "Aneesh", occupation: "CSE Student" }),
    React.createElement(Person, { name: "Ted", occupation: "Actor" }),
  ]);
};

// Call the App using ReactDom.render function to render the App on the html element with id="root"
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementByID("root"));
```

- See, this is as simple as it is without create-react-app. We simply don't need it. But remember, the main problem here is that we need to setup our own bundler for deployment. This is a small problem.
- To use classes, we can simply extend React.Component and follow the same thing. Thats all.

## Corollary - Updating packages

- To update packages, we can use yarn or npm. just see the list of packages using yarn list {package names\*\*\*\*}
- We can always use the updated version by updating the dependences using the carat symbol before your package which u want to upgrade.

## The problem of setState()

- One of the most important thing about setState() is that it is a async function. It will be finished whenever it wants to. This is because, React sometimes batches multiple setState into one big setState and updates the DOM to improve performance.
- The problem here is that there can be a issue of dirty read or dirty update. Simple Resource clashes which can break the app.
- Hence, the best practice to setState() is to follow the following method

```js
this.setState((prevState, prevProps) => {
  if (prevProps.hidden == false) {
    return {
      stateValue: prevState.stateValue + prevProps.increment,
    };
  } else {
    return {
      stateValue: prevState.stateValue + 1,
    };
  }
});
```

- The above is the best practice as this makes sure the setState function always uses the latest copy of the previous state and the props, hence, avoiding dirty read and write. ALWAYS USE THIS!!

# Redux

- Redux is the 3rd party library which helps in react state management.
- See, the main problem with the current state management is that it has too many connections with each other causing a sense of confusion. This confusion increases more and more with more components. But what if we can avoid this?
- What if we maintain a HUGE global state storing area where all the state needed are stored/managed and kept safe. Well, here is the thing. We know the main reason for messy comms with components is that each of them holds a state and a state change interacts with other components (possibly their state) which affects another and so on. This is the reason for the confusion. We can avoid this by maintaining a HUGE state storage area.
- The idea is simple. Maintain a huge state management place and pass each state elements as props to the components. This causes all the components to respond to a single person for any state related operations, hence, forcing all components to communicate at a single point. This is REDUX. Atleast the idea of it

## Redux Concepts

- Redux is really good at managing a large complicated state. It helps us manage huge apps. React is good at view layers but bad at state management.
- Redux is useful for sharing data between components, like state sharing. Lets say there is two same level components who wish to share state. Unfortunately, they can't due to unidirectional data flow. Hence, with base React, we have to init the parent with the state and share it with the components. Now, with redux and its global state repo, we can share states among components regardless of their position in the app architecture.
- Redux has a set of 3 principles called as redux principles which makes redux state predictable af.

## 3 Principles of Redux

1. Single Source of Truth - One single object that holds all our states and describes our app. Redux will take care of that object for you. YOU DONT WORRY ABOUT STATES.
2. State is read only! - This forces immutability stopping dirty read/write and unexpected errors this way. Well how do you change state? This is simple, for every state change, you have to instantiate a new state object and push it to the state management object
3. Changes are made only using pure functions - Pure functions recieve an input and always returns an output that is highly predictable.

## Redux Flow

- The flow of redux is as follows. All actions trigger an action input object which is inputed to a SINGLE Redux Root Reducer function. The Root Reducer function maps each actions to a corresponding state properity. This is propagated to the Redux Store where the entire state is stored in a DB style. The Store recieves the trigger and changes the state forcing the react to change the view. SIMPLE RYT.

## So everything is forced to be centralized with Redux?

- NO!! it is not. See, redux will not force you to keep all states in the redux store. It just gives you that option. Thats all! You can still keep states inside components if you want and also use redux store at the same time. NO PROBLEMA. One thing to remember is that redux follows the Flux Software Pattern, while react is MVC, hence, mix and match is viable with MVCs as much as we want.
- "When central can't HODL, all things fall apart, hence, we allow users to use MVC technique along with redux" -Redux devs

## How to write Redux?

- First, we need to understand how to write our reducer functions. The idea of reducer functions for redux is that each SET of components will have a reducer function which handles those component's state. Any state change calls these reducer functions which is coupled with bigger reducer functions which finally reduces all these down to one simple query. The query is passed to the root reducer! The BIG CHUNGAS.
- Hence 1st rule. Lets see how to write a reducer function

### Redux Reducer Function:

- A reducer handles a slice of the global states/redux store. Every reducer takes an action, which has a data that consist of a type (a string) and the payload (the changes to take place in the state).
- The reducer cross checks with the property and the datatype and applies the payload to the state which in turn triggers the react to run the render function.

```js
const userReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_CURRENT_USER":
      return {
        ...state,
        currentUser: action.payload,
      };

    case "REMOVE_CURRENT_USER":
      return {
        ...state,
        currentUser: null,
      };

    default:
      return state; // All reducers listen to all action, if an action is irrelevant for this reducer, then ignore it and return the state untouched.
  }
};

// action = {type: "SET_CURRENT_USER", payload: {currentState: "Joel"}};
```

- Thats all. Simple. The state is the current state on the time of action call.
- NOTE: Always remember, You have to return a new state object. REMEMBER, States are READ ONLY IN REDUX. Hence, u need to make a completely new state object and return it to the react. SRY!!! this is for your gud.

### Redux Middlewares:

- In the redux flow, every action talks to the redux reducers. Now, we can plug in middlewares b/n this communication to read the data and do operations with it before the data reaches the middleware.
- One such middleware is redux-logger which helps us debug our redux codes.
- to install it, use the package `redux-logger`.

# Setup and Start Redux

- to use redux, install `redux` and `react-redux`.
- Then add the wrapper of redux over the entire App component - called as Provider Component which we can get it from "react-redux". NOTE: You have to do this in the index.js

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

// Redux utils
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

// import Routing functionals
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

- The provider consists of all the functions needed to access the redux store. Hence, we wrap the entire app with it so that everyone can access the store.

## Setting up Store - Starting with root reducers

- The first rule to start the redux is to write the root reducer code and break our apps into small reducers which can handle a particular set of components' states.
- Remember, always maintain the root reducer as a place where we combine all the smaller reducers together to form the global state management system.

### Lets start with a small reducer first.

- lets make a small reducer. Reducer is a function which takes a current state object and a action object which has a type:string (the action to take) and the payload:object (the new state to update for the current chosen action (optional))
- NOTE: the state here is something the redux store would pass to this reducer. Remember, the redux store calls the reducer after an action is triggered. Hence, it is evident the state arg here is obtained from the redux store.
- Because of this, we need to set an initial state for each reducers and send this state as a default value to the reducer functions. (IMPORTANT!)

```js
const INITIAL_STATE = {
  currentUser: null,
};

const userReducer = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {
  // Can also use if-else-if statements if needed
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_CURRENT_USER":
      // modify only the current user. spread all other state values as usual
      return {
        ...state,
        currentUser: action.payload,
      };

    default:
      // this is to handle if the userReducer has no actions to do for the type given
      // We wish the reduce the state we got untouched so that we dont bug it.
      return state;
  }
};

export default userReducer;
```

- We need to set the default and handle cases where we dont handle the given action.type. This is necessary as all the reducers will be called with the current state. Since, only one reducer SHOULD affect the state at a time, if at all, a reducer doesn't handle an action.type, it has to return the state untouched.

## Combining the small reducer with the root reducer:

- Remember, we need to combine these small reducers to the root reducer to make the big global state storage.
- to combine reducers. import the combineReducer function from "redux".
- then follow the snippet

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

import userReducer from "./user/user.reducer";

export default combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
});
```

- Thats all. its as simple. Now we can use the root reducer and all its sub-reducers by importing rootReducer from the js files.

## Now, the big Chungas. Make the STORE!!

- create a store.js file and import createStore and applyMiddleware function from "redux".
- also, import logger from redux-logger as it is a gud middleware to put in for debugging purpose
- To make a store use the createStore function which takes 2 args. First arg is the root reducer and second arg is the applyMiddleware function with all the middlewares added in it.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";

// import middlewares
import logger from "redux-logger";

// import rootreducers
import rootreducers from "./root-reducer";

const middlewares = [logger]; // add all middleware here.

// make your store here
const store = createStore(rootreducers, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));

export default store;
```

- now import this store in index.js file and add it as a store prop in the Provider Component like this.

```js
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

- Now every component in the `<App />` component will be able to access the store. One last piece is left. TO DEFINE THE ACTIONS. These are quite simple, we will define a function to implement the action trigger which triggers the reducers.

## Setup the Action Creator Functions

- Actions are literally functions that return objects and represent a particular supported action of a reducer.

```js
export const setCurrentUser = (user) => ({
  type: "SET_CURRENT_USER",
  payload: user,
});
```

- the above is a simple action function for setting current user. we make a user.action.js and put this here.
- Thats all. Now, to set the user, instead of using this.state.currentUser, we can import the setCurrentUser action function and call it. This function will return the action object with the type and the payload which is then passed to a reducer function for processing with redux.

## Viola!! You done setup. Now how to call?

### The tragedy of connect() and mapStateToProps() (;\_;)

- Now how do we use the store in a component? For this, we need a functions imported from "react-redux" called as connect() (A higher order function)
- See, connect is a higher order function which takes two args. We pass the component which requires redux store using the connect. Now, the 1st arg of connect() is going to be the function that allows us to access the store state which in our case is the root reducer.
- To do this, we create a function called mapStateToProps() (For mapping state to props as the name says). We create like this to access the user states from root reducer

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  currentUser: state.user.currentUser,
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Header);
```

- thats all, now the header component can access the global store for currentUser state value present in the user properity in root reducer.
- So now what is the second arg of connect(). Well!! its another tragedy

### The tragedy of mapDispatchToProps() (Y_Y):

- Now, we have changed our component to access a property in the store.
- Now how will we trigger the action functions? This is where the mapDispatchToProps come to play
- to do this, we first import `connect()` as usual in the component where we wish to trigger the action.
- Then, we define a function called mapDispatchToProps() which takes an arg dispatch and calls the action trigger. This means, we also have to import the action functions.

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  setCurrentUser: (user) => dispatch(setCurrentUser(user)),
});

export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

- The above function mapDispatchToProps associates a functon called setCurrentUser(user) to the component App.
- The setCurrentUser is dispatched to store to call the setCurrentUser action function from the user.action.js
- Now, to trigger the action, the App component can simply do this.props.setCurrentUser(user). Thats all.
- NOTE: we made the 1st arg null here becauase we dont want our App component to read any redux store state. If it needs, then we need to set that up with mapStateToProps() function like last time and pass it in there.

## Optimization - using reselect
- There is a optimization problem. All the time, redux gets a completely new state object. This means every components which use redux WILL BE RE-RENDERED (Not gud for performance).
- Due to this redux habit, the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps are always called forcing the component to re-render even though there is no prop change for that component.
- To avoid this, we can use a technique called memoization. This is implemented for us in the reselect library. 
- reselect checks the props and sees if there is a change. If there is no change, it will avoid re-rendering the prop.
- First, lets install reselect
```sh
yarn install reselect
```
- Now, we need to add a file called selector files which allows us to define our reselectors.
- There are 2 types of selectors - input selector and output selector.

### input selector
- It is a function that takes the whole state object and returns a slice of it.

```jsx
const selectCart = state => state.cart;
```

### output selector
- this is again another function which takes an input selector's output (which is a slice of a state) and returns a output derived from the state (cart.cartItems).
- This function is created using the `createSelector()` function present in the reselect library.
- the `createSelector()` takes two input args: 1. is a list of inputselector functions and 2. is a function that takes the output from the inputSelectors (IN ORDER) and gives the output.
- Now since, this function is made with the `createSelector()` function. It is now memoized as in it will using caching and save us a lot of time and performance. 

## The dispatch shorthand
- we don't need to always make mapDispatchToProps() function all the time. connect() function passes the dispatch function as a prop to the component while it passes mapStateToProps() function.
- We can use this dispatch() prop function within the component to issue in-line dispatch calls to redux.

# PERSISTENCE STORAGE (very important)
- with every reload, we lose all the states in our redux and on our react components.
- With persistence storage facilities, we can persist the state and keep it safe so that the user can resume the process.
- Now, we need to know that redux reducers is just a JSON object at the end of the day. Hence, a persistence in client side is simplying dumping it in the client side temporary storage (or) use a special library called redux persist.
- on our `window` object in console, we have access to `window.localStorage` (holds data until we clear the temp storage in the OS) and `window.sessionStorage` (holds data until the tab is open)

## windows.localStorage()
- has two functions: `getItem()` and `setItem()`. The getItem() helps us pull out data from local storage and the setItem() helps us store an item in the local item.
- The items are stored as strings associated with a key. Hence, we need to make a key: value pair. The value has to be compulsorily be string - for this, we can do `JSON.stringify({JSON Object})`.
- To use getItem(), input the key and use `JSON.parse()` to parse the stringified data and use it

```js
const myObject = {
  name: "Joel Raymann J",
  app: "husky",
  version: 0.1,
};

window.localStorage.setItem("myItem", JSON.stringify(myObject)); // stores the object in temp.

// to retrieve it
let retrievedObject = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("myItem")); // get the data back
```

## windows.sessionStorage()
- Same as `windows.localStorage() except the data is stored for the current session and dies if the tab is closed or if the browser is closed. All functions are same like localStorage.

## Redux Persist
- this is a library that allows us to persist redux reducer objects and states easily.
- to use it, first install the `redux-persist` package.
- Now, this library comes with out-of-box functions to persist store, reducer and state. To persist the a reducer or a stage. We need to do the following:
- Import the `persistStore()` from `redux-persist` and make a new const persistor which calls the `persistStore()` function.

```js
import { persistStore } from "redux-persist";

export const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddlewares(...middlewares));

export const persistor = persistStore(store);

export default { store, persistor };
```

- next, we need to modify the root reducer now and use `persistReducer()` function to tell which reducer to persist. For this, we do the following:

```js
// this code combines all other states together.
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { persistReducer } from "redux-persist";
import storage from "redux-persist/lib/storage";

import userReducer from "./user/user.reducer";
import cartReducer from "./cart/cart.reducer";

const persistConfig = {
  key: "root", // the root key.
  storage,
  whitelist: ["cart"], // the list of reducers, we wish to store is mentioned here.
};

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  cart: cartReducer,
});

export default persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);
```
- 1st, we need to define the persistConfig object with the main key, the storage which we will use (localStorage is used here. For sessionStorage, see what to import from redux docs.), and the whitelist array. The whitelist array will have the list of strings which were used as key for the reducer. We will mention the keys of all the reducer objects which we wish to store, as strings in this list of whitelist array.
- 2nd, we will wrap the rootReducer with the `persistReducer()` function which takes the config and the rootReducer as its two args.
- Finally, we need to go to `index.js` and add a component called `PersistGate` from `redux-persist/integration/react`. Then wrap this component over the `<App />` component. REMEMBER, you also need import the persistor object we made to persist the store in the beginning of this. You need to import that and pass it as a prop to `PersistGate` component. The finally code of `index.js` will be like this.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

// import redux utils
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { PersistGate } from "redux-persist/integration/react";

// import store here
import { store, persistor } from "./redux/store";

// import Routing functionals
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <PersistGate persistor={persistor}>
        <App />
      </PersistGate>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

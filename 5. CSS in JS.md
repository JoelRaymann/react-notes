# CSS in JS
## Whats the problem in the traditional style:
- Traditionally, we used to make a JSX component and its styles in a seperate SCSS/CSS file and link it in JSX.
- The way we link it is by using the CSS namespacing (where, we name each html component with a classname or id and style those in the CSS)
- The problem in this, is that CSS uses Global namespacing and hence, down the road, during development, if someone wants to implement another variant of the same component and uses the same CSS classname, then, our style will interfere with it and causes all sort of bugs.
- Ofc, we can use the BEM standards of naming for CSS but it is a huge mental overhead for new developers. NOTE that in the modern era, browsers are wayyy too fast, hence, they can compile and execute JS scripts extremely fast.
- So, the solution seems quite simple. use CSS in JS itself

## How to CSS in JS?
- Including CSS in JS is quite simple. all we need to do is mention the styles in JS as a JS Object:
```jsx
const textStyles = {
    color: "red",
    fontSize: "24px",
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Card>
                <div style={textStyles}>I am a CSS Component</div>
            </Card>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
- The above applies the styles directly on the div JSX element tag. But whats the catch - Well, we can't access special selectors like :disabled, :hover, :before, :nth-child and many more stuffs. Hence, our thinking on applying CSS in JS have to be different than usual.
- To implement CSS in JS with ease, there are numerous libraries such as styled-components, radium, aphrodity etc. The most popular lib is styled-components.
- The con of this method is that it requires unusual design mindset and as mentioned earlier, we will not be able to access all the special selectors.
- The pro is that CSS in JS is extremely fast and performance-wise, it is a major optimization (note that browsers are really really fast in the modern era.).

## Getting started with Styled-Components
- Add the styled-components library: `yarn add styled-components`
- Now we need to import it using the following
```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";
```
- The styled keyword allows us to access the entire library functionalities. Now, we do the following to use styled-components:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Text = styled.div`
    color: "red";
    font-size: 24px;
`;

function App() {    
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Card>
                <Text>I am a CSS Component</Text>
            </Card>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
- Viola, we achieved the same styling here. Thats all. Quite simple ryt?
- The format is simple: Define a styling variable with using:
```jsx
const StyledTag = styled.{JSX Tag on what u want to apply the styles on}`
{your normal CSS styles for this tag}
`;
```
- Behind the scene, the styled-component library makes a unique classname and apply it over the JSX tag. With this, we can add our own classname and use those special selectors OR we can use styled-components to handle that also with their functions.
- One thing to note here is that, thanks to shifting our styles in JS, we can now use props to influence and control the styles (earlier, we would have to set up a if-else stuff and switch between classnames).

## Using props in our styled components
- We can use props to influence our styles. Here is an example on how to do this.
```jsx
const Text = styled.div`
    color: "red";
    font-size: 24px;
    border: ${({ isActive }) => {
        if (isActive) {
            const borderLength = 1;
            return `${borderLength}px solid black`;
        } else 
            return "3px dotted green";
    }}
`;

function App() {    
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Card>
                <Text isActive={true}>I am a CSS Component</Text>
            </Card>
        </div>
    );
}
```
- This is extremely powerful as we can now control and even do special operations to affect our styles.

## Making custom styled components
- If we want to style a React Component, we can do the following:
```jsx
export const StyledCustomComponent = styled({CustomComponent})`
  {CSS Styles}
`;
```
- A example would be:
```jsx
export const LogoContainer = styled(Link)`
  height: 100%;
  width: 70px;
  padding: 25px;
`;
```
## Making Custom Classes to share
- In order to create a set of styles for reusing it across multiple JSX elements, we have to import `css`  from `styled-components` and do the following:

```jsx
const {className} = css`
  {css class styles}
`; // define your class based css here

export const {StyledTagElement} = styled.{tagElement}`
    ${{classname}}
`; // use it like this.
```

- A simple example is

```jsx
const OptionClass = css`
  padding: 10px 15px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
  cursor: pointer;
`;

export const OptionLink = styled(Link)`
  ${OptionClass}
`;

export const OptionDiv = styled.div`
  ${OptionClass}
`;
```

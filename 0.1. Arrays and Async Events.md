# JS Advanced Concepts
## Array Methods
Array Methods are special methods which allows us to access and manipulate array elements

### map(callback()):
Maps is a function that applies a callback function for each element in the array
NOTE: Element need not be an argument in the callback
```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
myArray = myArray.map((value, index) => {
    return value + 1;
})
// Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
### filter(callback()):
Filter takes a callback function which considers an element and returns either true or false. If returned true, the element is kept in the array. If false, it is pruned out of the array.
```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
myArray = myArray.map((value, index) => {
    if (value % 2 === 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
});
// Output: [2, 4]
```
### includes(element, [start_index, end_index]):
Includes takes an element and checks if it exist in the array. If it does, then returns true else false. Optional arg. includes start_index and end_index which searches for that element from the start_index to end_index.
```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(myArray.includes(2));
// Output: true
```
NOTE: Includes doesn't work properly for array of objects due to the way objects are stored in memory.

### find(callback())
find takes individual element from the array and runs the callback function and returns the element when the callback returns true. It also stops running the moment it receives a true.
```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(myArray.find((ele) => ele === 3));
// Output: 3
console.log(myArray.find((ele) => ele > 2));
// Output: 3 // NOTE: it won't run further the moment it receives true. 
```

### reduce(callback(accumulator, element), initialValue)
The reduce function reduces the array to a single element. Simulates the reduce_sum and reduce_mean algorithms in TensorFlow and stuff. The reduce takes two argument:
1. A callback function which takes two args: (accumulator, element). The accumulator is the previous element's return value obtained by calling this callback function.
2. initialValue is the initial value of the accumulator when the index is at 0 or the beginning of the array.
```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(
    myArray.reduce((accumulator, element) => {
        return accumulator + element;
    }, 0)
);
// output: 10 // Does the reduce_sum over the array
```

## JS Async Event Handling
With ES6, promises was introduced for Async event handling.
### Promises
 - before promises, we faced a huge problem when handling error upon using API.
 - There were too many try-catch blocks - a try catch within try catch within try catch and so on. This caused a long list of uncontrolled and shabby code.
 - Promises were introduced to simplify the error handling.
 - Promises allowed to daisy chain another promise and hence, reduced the line of if-try-catch blocks.
```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Code here your logic
    if (success) 
        resolve(value);
    else 
        reject(value);
})

myPromise.then((value) => {
    console.log(`Resolved with ${value}`);
}).catch((value) => {
    console.log(`Rejected with ${value}`);
});
```
 - The then call allows us to access resolve value and the catch allows us to access the reject value.
 - Resolve is used for proper events and reject for error handling. Until either resolve or reject is called, the promise will be kept in a pending state. The thread will still be executing the remainder of the code, while another thread will handle this promise and prompt the main thread upon a response. 
 - NOTE: Promises can be daisy chained if needed to handle multiple try-catch scenarios.

### Async Await
 - This is an addition to ES6. The async await reduces the amount of code needed to implement async calls with promises. It is a substitute for promises.
```js
const myAsyncFunction = async () => {
    const userResponse = await fetch("Some http API call");
    const users = await userResponse.json();
    const secondUser = users[1];
    console.log(secondUser);
    const postsResponse = await fetch(
        "Another http API userID=" + secondUser.id
    );
    const posts = await postsResponse.json();
    console.log(posts)
}
```
 - The above is a small example of async function being called for fetching a user response and reading the second user and fetching another response. The await keyword is placed before a promise or a asynchronous function.
 - The await keyword waits for the response or reject from the async function or promise and returns the value to the variable. This allows us to reduce the code length.
 - The above code would have been written in promises as follows:
```js
fetch("Some http API call")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(users => {
        const secondUser = users[1];
        console.log(secondUser);
        return fetch(
            "Another http API userID=" + secondUser.id
        );
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(posts => console.log(posts));
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
    })
```
 - Quite the code ryt!! and confusing as hell. But hey, its ur choice. You can use whatever u want!
 - The beauty of async is that it feels like sync code. The async feels neat and like sync. Async is more readable.
 - Now how to handle errors with Async. Well, we need to use try-catch. But wait. We need just one try-catch. Not like the try-catch hell. It goes like this.
```js
const myAsyncFunction = async () => {
    try {
        const userResponse = await fetch("Some http API call");
        const users = await userResponse.json();
        const secondUser = users[1];
        console.log(secondUser);
        const postsResponse = await fetch(
            "Another http API userID=" + secondUser.id
        );
        const posts = await postsResponse.json();
        console.log(posts)
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`[ERROR]: ${error}`);
    }
};
```
- See, This is quite ez and readable. AGAIN. Its your choice. Either use Async awaits or use daisy chained promises. Your Choice.

# Asynchronisation in Redux
- Asynchronized calls are quite common in applications, especially during DB calls. Till now, we used redux in a synchronized manner.
- We will now learn the concepts of asynchronization and reactiveness in JS and later go in-depth with async redux

## The concept of subscription: Observer-Observable Pattern
- The concept of observable-observer is similar to producer-consumer concept.
- Lets assume there is a stream of linear time based events like user clicking a button at multiple times each done on a different time note. Now, this event is linear in time and is a concurrent sequence of events. 
- The observable are piece of code(s) which wraps around these events and allows us to kinda like hook into these events.
- The observer is a one which handles the values returned by these observable hooks. The observer consists of 3 functions: 1. `next: (nextValue) => {// do something with the observable value}`, 2. `error: (error) => {// handle error}` and 3. `complete: () => {// Do something when the observable event hook is done}`.  
- Now, we need to understand when these three functions are called. Note that a observable is a sequence of events and a observer is basically "hooking" to these events via "subscribing" to the observable. Now, on subscription, the observer gets values for all the events. For each of these values, the `next()` function is called to handle this scenario. Furthermore, the `error()` function is called if there is any exception during these events. Now, every sequence of events has a end. So when the observable is closed or when the sequence of events culminates and ends, the `complete()` function is called.
- The "hooking" up to the observable is called subscribing or listening to the events. For every subscription from the observer to the observable, the observer implements the  3 functions and gives to the observable. I
- Note: The observable runs as usual even without a subscription and a observable can have multiple subscriptions.
- NOTE: RxJS is a library that implements the observable-observer pattern but sometimes, it is just overwhelming.

## Asynchronize Redux - Thunking with Redux Thunk
- `redux-thunk` is a library that provides a middleware called `thunk` which when included allows us to get the redux dispatcher and use it to handle asynchronous events.
- To use `redux-thunk`. Add the library and import it in the redux-store file. Include the thunk as a middleware in the redux store.
```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { persistStore } from "redux-persist";

// import middlewares
import logger from "redux-logger";
import thunk from "redux-thunk"; // including the thunk boiis here

// import rootreducers
import rootReducers from "./root.reducer";

const middlewares = [thunk]; // add all middleware here.

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  middlewares.push(logger);
} else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
}

// make your store here
export const store = createStore(rootReducers, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));

export const persistor = persistStore(store);

export default { store, persistor };
```
- Now, once this is done, we can now get the dispatch and use it to our needs. Now How this helps us is that, we have control over when a dispatcher calls some redux action.
- This means, we can execute a promise and once the promise is successful, we can dispatch a success action, else, we can dispatch a failure action. The way we do this is simple. Lets assume, we are fetching user information from the backend.
- The first basic thing we do to do a async call with redux is to make sure everyone knows the state/progress of the fetch call. This can be easily indicated by implementing 3 functions indicating 3 states of a simple async call: 1. Start async 2. Async Success, 3. Async Failure.
- Lets assume there are 3 actions types handling this in our user info fetching case. These actions are namely: 1. `UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_START`, 2. `UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_SUCCESS` and 3. `UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_FAILURE`. 
- Now a typical async code would be as follows:
```js
import UserActionTypes from "./user.types";

export const fetchUserStart = () => {
  return {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_START,
  };
};

export const fetchUserSuccess = (UserObject) => {
  return {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_SUCCESS,
    payload: UserObject,
  };
};

export const fetchUserFailure = (errorMessage) => {
  return {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_FAILURE,
    payload: errorMessage,
  };
};

export const fetchUserAsync = () => {
    // return a function that takes the dispatch arg.
    return (dispatch) => {

        // Fire the fetch start action
        dispatch(fetchUserStart());

        fetch("some url")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // fire the 
            dispatch(fetchUserSuccess(data));
        })
        .catch(error => {
            dispatch(fetchUserFailure(error.message));
        });
    };
}

```
- As we can see, the above actions handle the 3 basic states of a fetch call. The action we will be using is the `fetchUserAsync()` action. This action returns a function that takes the dispatch as argument and uses it to call the 3 basic state actions we implemented for the user fetch.
- This is the general norms to handle async call in redux. NOTE: we are able to get the dispatch of redux and use it in our action is due to the redux thunk middleware.

## What is redux thunk doing?
- Generally, a dispatch of an action would make the redux run the action function and get the action object. In general norms, redux expects an action object from the action functions so that it can use the associated reducers.
- But, when the action function returns another function instead of an action object, then the redux reducer will not know how to handle it and it leads to break down of the app.
- When redux thunk is added as middleware, the entire story changes. The thunk middleware checks each action functions return objects and sees if it is an action object or a function. When it is an action object, it ignores it.
- When a function is returned, then the thunk gets an instance of the redux dispatcher and sends it as the first argument of that returned function. Following this, it will execute the function asynchronously without involving the reducers or the redux operations. 
- Using this function, a user can fire multiple action functions using the dispatch instance he has within this function which is provided as 1st argument by the redux-thunk. Hence, this allows us to handle async calls seamlessly. NOTE: this need not be restricted to async calls alone. This can be extended to handle any actions with require multiple sub-actions and soo on. Each of these sub-actions can be fired with that dispatch instance we have in a linear fashion.

# Caching

- Caching is a way to store the values
- Memorization is a way to cache content in JS
- With caching, we can avoid doing the same calc.

# Memoization
 - it is a technique to cache and return the output for a set of params.
 - This allows us to mitigate the calc time to get the output by caching the output for that set of params.

# Heroku
## Introduction
- Heroku is a PaaS that allows web hosting for any time of backend projects such as Node, Python, JSP and PHP projects
- With heroku, we can host our react app along with a backend
- Heroku provides a CLI for us to directly upload our project and host it in heroku through our cmd line.

## Getting started
- First, we need to install the Heroku CLI command, then login in our CMD using `heroku login` command
- After this, we can create our heroku app using `heroku create` command.
- NOTE: heroku uses git like command so it almost work like git where we push code and we tell heroku on how to build and serve the web. 

## Getting started for React Apps
- The best practice with react apps is that we want to serve only HTML, CSS and JS files i.e. we want to serve static pages which gives the feel of dynamic pages with the react js scripts. Hence, to do this, we first create the heroku app as follows:

```sh
heroku create {URL NAME} --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
```
- buildpack argument creates configuration files on which we can mention how to build the webapp. 
- In our case, we will use another previously done buildpack files from the following git.
- After this, a new heroku tree is spawned in our github repo. All we need to do is push our master branch to the heroku tree

```sh
git push heroku master
```
- and, viola, our app is LIVE!!

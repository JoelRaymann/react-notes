# Higher Order Component Pattern
- Higher order components are components that return an entire function or a component as a return value.
- Functions such as `connect()` (in `react-redux`), `withRouter()` (in `react-router-dom`) etc. are all HOC functions that takes an argument component and returns another component with add in functionalities accordingly.

## How to write HOC
- The basic idea is that these `functions` or `component` must return another function or component as such. A simple HOC without any argument would be like this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import DummyComponent from '../components/dummy/dummy.component.jsx";

const HOCComponent = () => {
    // Remember that HOC must return a function or a modified component
    // Some operations
    let a = 10;
    // blah blah

    // this must return a component or a function
    return (a) => {
        const b = a + 10;
        return <DummyComponent a={a} b={b} />;
    }
};

export default HOCComponent;
```
- The above is a HOC component with takes no argument and returns a component.
- More advanced components like Spinner or Loading components take a component and display it if it gets a single that the loading is done. For these functionalities, spinners and loading components have to be higher-order component as they need to return a component when the loading is done. Here is an example of a spinner component which displays a spinner when loading and when loading is done - it displays the actual component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { SpinnerOverlay, SpinnerContainer } from "./with-spinner.styles.jsx";

const WithSpinner = (WrappedComponent) => {
    // The wrapped component is the one that would be displayed
    // when the loading is done.

    // Return a function
    const Spinner = ({ isLoading, ...otherProps }) => {
        // using isLoading Boolean to toggle between loading mode or finished mode
        return isLoading ? (
            // The state: loading
            // Display spinner
            <SpinnerOverlay>
                <SpinnerContainer />
            </SpinnerOverlay>
        ) : (
            // The state: Loaded.
            // Return the wrapped component for display
            <WrappedComponent {...otherProps} />
        );
    }
    return Spinner;
};

export default WithSpinner;
```
- Remember, HOC is a function that takes a component (generally, sometimes nothing) and returns a function/modified component

# React Routing

- React doesn't provide us with routing. Remember, it is just a UI Library. This means we need to implement routing on our own.
- Previously, we weren't able to go back and forth in our websites. But recently, there has be a plethora of innovation in web browser. A new History API is given to us by the browsers which allow us to get data back and forth from previous webpage to current webpage and so on. Libraries used these API to provide us with routing techniques out of the box.

# What is routing?

- routing is the technique to render different pages in the SPA page.

# How to route with React?

- To route with react, we have an external package called as react router DOM. Its ez and follows our component type structure.
- Install `react-router-dom` package to use it in the project.

To Route, we first import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom

```js
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
```

- The BrowserRouter component consists of all the functionality of routing in it and it exposes these functions to its children components. Hence, to expose these functionality to a component, we simply wrap that component with the `<BrowserRouter></BrowserRouter>` tags

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

- The above code gives all routing capabilities to the App component in the React app

# How to use routing in components?

- Now we know how to add routing functionals to a component, to do routing in a component, simply import { Route } from "react-router-dom". After that, we can set the routing using the `<Route>` component.
- The Route component takes three primary arguments. 1. exact (To render the component only if the path exactly matches. else trash it.) 2. path (the path to associate a page component) 3. component (the component to associate and render for that path). For ex:

```js
import HomePage from "./pages/homepage/homepage.component";
import RegisterPage from "./pages/RegisterPage/RegisterPage.component";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route exact={true} path="/home" component={HomePage} />
      <Route exact={true} path="/register" component={RegisterPage} />
    </div>
  );
}
// Now for <URL>/home - the react would render HomePage component and for <URL>/register the react would render RegisterPage component.
```

## Switch Component

- Switch component is present in react-router-dom which wraps a set of routes and outputs the first matching route in the path.
- Switch makes sure that only one route is handled and hence, protects us from rendering multiple routes due to path mismatch.
- NOTE: The moment switch sees a path that is included by a route without an exact, it will return that path and stops looking.

## 3 Arguments of routing

- Any components rendered by the router component is given 3 arguments/props called as history, location and match prop.

### Match Prop

- The match prop consists of the following properties

```js
match:
    isExact: true,
    params: {},
    path: "/topics/",
    url: "/topics/"
```

- The isExact is telling us how the routing matching happen. Whether the URL is matched with exactness or with laziness.
- params is the parameter passed in the URL path.
- path is the URL path which was matched by the router.
- url is the URL path typed by the user on the browser.
- In order to use the params, we need to recieve the parameters in the route path using the `home/path/:param` way where the `param` is a parameter.

```jsx
const TopicPage = (props) => {
    console.log(props.match.params.topicId); // accesses the topicId parameter
}

function App() {
    return (
        <Route exact path="/topic/:topicId" component={TopicPage}>
    );
}

```

### History Prop

- The history is quite complicated but for simplicity, lets consider history as a prop that allows us a special property called as `push()`. The push method allows us to hijack the URL and append the URL with our own strings.

```js
return (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => props.history.push("/topics")}>Topics</button>
  </div>
); // clicking the button appends /topics to the URL hence, facilitating the re-route.
```

- The main advantage of this is that the props can be used in any function or lifecycle methods, hence, giving us access to routing in methods such as `componentWillUpdate()`, `componentDidUpdate()` etc. and so on.

### Location prop

- This tells us where we are in the App in terms of URL.
- This can help us read the URL pathname typed in the browser.

## Prop Tunnelling/Drilling:

- We saw how props of a routing gives us the history prop which in-turn helps us to push string in the url and all. But sometimes, we want this history prop deep into a child component.
- NOTE: the history prop is always given the component which is rendered by the route component. Now, say there is a child component which needs the history prop, it can't access it without giving it as a prop itself. This method of passing the props into the child one after the other to make the prop reach the correct child component is called prop tunnelling and we need to avoid it like a plague. ITS A BAD DESIGN. COMPONENTS ARE MEANT TO BE STANDALONE - THIS TIES THEM TOGETHER MAKING US LOSE OUR SWEET MODULARITY.

## Prop Tunnelling Solution:

- There are many solutions offered by many 3rd party packages. In our case, the `react-router-dom` package offers a novel solution with its high-level component function called as `withRouter()` function. (A high-level component function is a function which takes component, modifies it and returns the modified component)
- With the `withRouter()` function, we can make a child component access the history of a parent component directly.

```js
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom";

const MenuItem = ({ title, imageUrl, history }) => (
  <div className="menu-item" onClick={() => history.push("menuURL")}>
    <h1 className="title">{title.toUpperCase()}</h1>
    <span className="subtitle">SHOP NOW</span>
  </div>
);

export default withRouter(MenuItem);
```

- The `withRouter()` function modifies the MenuItem component to accept the history of its parent component without any need for prop drilling across all the middle child components b/n MenuItem component and the App component

## Collorary: render prop of Route

- This property tells the Route what to render in the page. This is just like component property but allows us to write JS program in it as a function. NOTE: we can either use render or component property. NOT BOTH

## Collorary: Redirect Component.

- With the Redirect component, we can redirect the page to another page. To do this, we call

```jsx
<Route exact path="/" component={<Redirect to="/error" />} />
```

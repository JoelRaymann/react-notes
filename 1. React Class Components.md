# Class Components

## LifeCycle components

### Mounting Phase

- This phase is the phase were our component is staged to render for the first time in the DOM.
- This phase involves running the `constructor()` followed by `render()` function followed by `componentDidMount()` function.
- This phase is were we put our state and base DOM elements/components in the DOM. We use `render()` method to put a base HTML to display.
- Once the `render()` function is done, React calls the `componentDidMount()` method is called. We can use this function to update the state or get JSON data using API calls. Remember, the moment we update the state, the `render()` function is called again but after that `componentDidMount()` will not be called again!!

### Updating Phase

- This phase is called when we change the state, prop or do a `forceUpdate()` function call.
- after a new prop or `setState()` call, React calls the `render()` function to re-render the DOM and then it will the lifecycle method `componentDidUpdate()`. This method can be used to make further changes to the state or prop if needed after the update. Remember this, this `componentDidUpdate()` will be called after every re-render!!!
- There is a in b/n method between prop/state/forceUpdate and the `render()` function and it is called `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` method. This allows us to peek the new change of state or prop and control the calling of `render()` and `componentDidUpdate()`. This method allows us to make the react code efficient and allows us to stop an unneccesary re-renders. NOTE: This function must return either true (ok render) or false (don't render).
- Use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to stop renders of child component when its props aren't changed or when the state change doesn't affect that child component.

### Unmounting Phase

- This phase is done when the component is destroyed from the HTML DOM.
- Before the component is stripped out of the DOM, it goes through this phase where it calls the `componentWillUnmount()`. This method can be used to clean up and do some garbage collection

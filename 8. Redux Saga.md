# Redux Saga
- Redux Saga is quite tough concept but not a great thing. The power Redux Saga gives is a lot. Sagas are pieces of code which act as a middleware functions and listen to all redux action calls. These functions execute only to a particular set of actions, hence, each saga can be associated with a set of actions and made to execute only for those actions.
- Now, what can we make it execute, well, there is a lot of things we can make it execute. One of the best things to do is use saga for asynchronous code executions or in general make it run side-effect codes.

- As seen in the figure, Sagas sit as a middleware and incepts the actions, firing the saga code for a set of actions it is meant to fire for.


## What is side effect codes:
- These can range from async code that fetches something from the backend or something that triggers an impure reaction.
- A pure code/function is a set of code which always gives the same output for the same set of inputs eg. Add(2, 3) will always give 5.
- A impure code/function is a set of code which will give different output for the same sef of inputs. How can this happen? Simple. Take a look at this code:
```js
let num = 5
const AddNumbers = (a, b) => {
    return (a + b + num);
};

console.log(AddNumbers(5, 4)); // output: 14
// change the num
num = 10;
console.log(AddNumber(5, 4)); // output: 19
```
- As we can see, how the `AddNumber()` function is a impure function and it is impure due to the external dependency it had with the `num` variable. As the `num` changes, the output changes for the same set of inputs.
- This external dependencies are similar to API request where the request input is same but the output changes each time due to the volatile nature of the output. This is the reason why Sagas were created. To handle such impure calls and async functions seamlessly without any hassle.
- Any async activities which is not related to a single component but the entire App execution depends on it, then we call such calls in a Saga and it is beneficial to call it in Saga.

## Generator Function - Building block for Sagas
- This is a new function introduced in the JS function. It is a type of function which keeps on giving out (`yields`) outputs. These functions doesn't have a return statement rather these have a yield statement which constantly returns outputs in a asynchronous fashion.
- A basic generator function is written in the following manner.

```js
// the generator function
function* generatorFunction() {
    console.log('a');
    console.log('b');
}

// gets a generator object
const g = generatorFunction();

// runs the generator function 1 time and returns an object
g.next();
```
- The function shown above is a basic generator with no return or yield. A generator object doesn't execute just like a normal function. We need to first initialize it to a variable like `g` in our case. Then, the `g` holds the thread that is associated to execute the function. Now to execute it, call `g.next()`. This executes the code and returns an object of the following type.
```js
{
    value: undefined,
    done: true,
}
```
- The value is the returned value of the generator and the done is a status boolean that tells if the function is executed completely or not. If a function is executed completely, then done is toggled as true and the function will not be executed again. Calling `g.next()` again will not do those `console.log`s anymore and will always return this object.

### Yield vs. Return:
- `yield` is a keyword like return but it doesn't end the function. Rather it suspends the generator by returning a value - This means we can resume the generator function with the `g.next()`. An example:
```js
function* addNumber(a, b, error) {
    yield a + b;
    yield a + b + error;
    return error;
};
const a = addNumber(5, 4, 10);

console.log(a.next());
console.log(a.next());
console.log(a.next());
```
- From the above code, the first `a.next()` returns the object 
```js 
{
    value: 9,
    done: false,
}
```
- The second `a.next()` executes till the next yield and then again suspends the generator function by returning the yield value as such
```js
{
    value: 19,
    done: false,
}
```
- The third `a.next()` executes till the next yield, but there is no yield. Instead, there is a return value. Now, the generator execution is closed and the return value is returned as such:
```js
{
    value: 10,
    done: true,
}
```
- As u can see, the done is toggled as true for the return statement. Anymore `a.next()` will always return the following object:

```js
{
    value: undefined,
    done: true,
}
```
- This is how yield works. It allows the generator function to run in a suspended state and doesn't close the generator function. 
- yield allows us to kinda pause the function and resume it later...kinda like that
- The redux saga is kinda like this, it allows us to pause an execution of a code - do something - resume again - pause again - do something - so on.......

## Redux Sagas
- To use redux-saga, we need to yarn add `redux-saga`.
- Now, redux-saga does the same thing as a redux-thunk except we have multiple features and control on how the async function is run.
- Previously, an async code with an await will stop the execute of the entire JS block. With thunks, we were able to handle it. Now the next problem is what if the user issues multiple thunks for the same action. Will the thunk keep on doing fetch request for every time the user does the same action - THINK OF THE NETWORK COST. We surely dont wanna do it. We only want to run the thunk for the most recent action. Unfortunately thunk doesn't give us this feature. Hence, for the same action, multiple thunks would be fired causing a callback hell. 
- Hence, the redux-saga was born to solve this. Saga does on thing, handles async code very efficiently by giving us option to stop a fetch request or a async request. This lets us run the latest fetch request always. Now, in a more intuitive way, sagas will spawn threads and gives us the action to close the thread whenever we want. Each saga will have a thread and runs concurrently with other sagas and JS code, hence, doesn't block the flow of the application.
- To use saga, we need to modify our store a little bit. Check the following code:
```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { persistStore } from "redux-persist";

// import middlewares
import logger from "redux-logger";
import createSagaMiddleware from "redux-saga"; // 1st import createSagaMiddleware from "redux-saga"

// 4th: import all your sagas
import { fetchShopItemsStart } from "./shop/shop.sagas"; 

// import rootreducers
import rootReducers from "./root.reducer";

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware(); // 2nd: Make the saga middleware 

const middlewares = [sagaMiddleware]; // add all middleware here. //3rd: Add it in the middleware

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  middlewares.push(logger);
} else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
}

// make your store here
export const store = createStore(rootReducers, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));

// 5th: Add your sagas here and run it as such
sagaMiddleware.run(fetchShopItemsStart);

export const persistor = persistStore(store);

export default { store, persistor };
```
- First, we import the `createSagaMiddleware` from `redux-saga` library. This allows us to make a sagaMiddleware which we can hook it up with the redux middleware streams.
- Second, we create the `sagaMiddleware` using the `createSagaMiddleware`.
- Third, we add it to the middleware stream
- Fourth, we import all our sagas we made and run it by using the `sagaMiddleware.run()` function. We add all our sagas here and the `sagaMiddleware.run()` tries to run all the sagas concurrently if possible.

### How to write a basic saga
- A saga is a generator function which must have a yield call. Now, to write a basic saga. First, create a saga file, something like `users.sagas.js` near the corresponding `users.reducer.js`
- Now, lets just say we want to `console.log("Hello")` from our saga. To do this, look at the following code:

```js
import { takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects/";

import ActionTypes from "./users.types";

// A saga function 
export function* fetchUserProfileAsync() {
    yield console.log("Hello");
}

// Write your listener for the saga
/**
* This function is a saga listener function which will listen to
* a particular set of actions and start firing sagas for each actions.
* This function would be imported into the store and run in the sagaMiddleware.run()
*/
export function* fetchUserProfileStart() { 
    // lets listen for the ActionTypes.FETCH_USER_PROFILE_START and fire the above saga
    yield takeEvery(
        ActionTypes.FETCH_USER_PROFILE_START, // the action type to listen to
        fetchUserProfileAsync, // The saga function to run
    );
}

```
- As we can see, its very easy, we start will creating a saga generator function which yields an output (most probably, the result of a fetch request) - This is a saga.
- Now, we need to run the saga - in our case the `fetchUserProfileAsync()` function. For this, we will need to make saga listener - in our case `fetchUserProfileStart()`.
- Saga will listen using a special function sets call effects. In our case, we are using `takeEvery` effect - this effect will respond for all actions similar to `ActionTypes.FETCH_USER_PROFILE_START`. There are a lot of effects we can use to listen to actions and capture it - do something like running a saga with it. NOTE: The saga listener function is the function which will be imported in the store.js and run in the sagaMiddleware using `sagaMiddleware.run()`.
- There are a lot of saga effects giving us different options to listen to sagas and firing functions.
- Now, the way the above code works is simple, The saga listener sits as a middleware and listens to the action listening by the effect function.
- Then, when the action is recieved, the listener function takes it and runs the corresponding saga function for the action. Thats all! quite simple.

### Advanced sagas
- When there are API Calls, sagas are the best to go for as they allow sort of a checkpointing option.
- Each yield in a saga function is a checkpoint which can be used to abruptly terminate the saga or suspend it indefinitely.
- A basic saga with API would look as such

```js
import { takeEvery, call, put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { convertUserToProfile } from "../../utils/user.utils";
import { fetchUserSuccess, fetchUserFailure } from "./users.actions";
import UserActionTypes from "./user.types";

/**
 * A redux saga function that executes the code needed
 * to fetch the user details asynchronously from the backend.
 *
 */
export function* fetchUserAsync() {
  try {
    const userResponse = fetch("https:// Some API CALL");
    // checkpoint 1: getting the JSON information
    const userJson = yield userResponse.json();
    // checkpoint 2: converting user JSON to user profile using external function.
    const userProfile = yield call(convertUserToProfile, userJson); // call is a effect function. 
    // Checkpoint 3: dispatching success
    yield put(fetchUserSuccess(userProfile));
  } catch (error) {
    // Checkpoint 3: dispatching failure if failed
    yield put(fetchUserFailure(error.message));
  }
}
```
- That all. Simple. But lets understand two things. First, all yield are kinda like checkpoints which allow us to break the saga function whenever we want to.
- Now, lets just say that the `convertUserToProfile()` function is a demanding task. Hence, we want to put a checkpoint on it, but, we can't use `yield convertUserToProfile(userJson)` although it is right - the reason being saga doesn't have control over that function in this way. Hence, for saga to control the function and allow us to break the code A.K.A execute it in a non-blocking manner - we need to use a special effect function called `call(func, ...args)`.
-  A function wrapped and yielded with a `call` function would let saga control and execute that function in a non-blocking manner allowing us to terminate it or suspend whenever we want!
-  Furthermore, after the success or failure, we want to dispatch an action but Saga doesnt have the dispatch instance like redux-thunk. Hence, saga has its own dispatcher called `put()` effect which allows us to send a `Saga Dispatch` action to the reducer
- `put()` Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to dispatch an action to the Store. This effect is non-blocking and any errors that are thrown downstream (e.g. in a reducer) will not bubble back into the saga, hence, avoiding multiple failures and callback hells.
- Thats all folks, with this knowledge, we can Sagafy any thunked activities quite easily. Remember, `yield` is our checkpoints allowing us to break at those points - use it with care.

### Effects in Saga
#### take() effect
- This is the most basic effect which listens to an action and gives us an option to receive the payload of the action
- `take()` has only one argument and it is the action type on which it listens for.
```js
import { take } from "redux-saga/effects";

import ActionTypes from "./action.types";

export function* basicSaga() {
    const payload = yield take(ActionTypes.BASIC_ACTION); // returns the payload as value.

    // do some action.
    console.log("Running Take() saga");
}
```
- Note that this saga only gets fired only once unlike `takeEvery()`. The console.log() message will be printed only once implies no matter how many times the BASIC_ACTION is fired, this saga will fire only for the first time and thats it - its over - it will not fire again like the `takeEvery()` type saga

#### takeEvery() effect
- As opposed to `take()` which listens and fires only one time, `takeEvery()` listens to an action and fires multiple times. It fires whenever the action is fired and doesn't run only one time like the `take()`.
- The usage of `takeEvery()` is a bit different - its first argument is the action type and the second argument is a generator function which we wish to run for this action type.

```js
import { takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects";
import ActionTypes from "./action.types";

export function* basicSagaFunction() {
    yield console.log("Running takeEvery() saga");
}

export function* basicSaga() {
    yield takeEvery(ActionTypes.BASIC_ACTION, basicSagaFunction); 
}
```
- Whenever ActionTypes.BASIC_ACTION is fired, the `basicSagaFunction` Saga function is also fired.
- We can implement `takeEvery()` functionalities with `take()` itself using while loop

```js
import { take } from "redux-saga/effects";

import ActionTypes from "./action.types";

export function* basicSaga() {
    
    while(true) {
        const payload = yield take(ActionTypes.BASIC_ACTION); // returns the payload as value.

        // do some action.
        console.log("Running take() saga like takeEvery()");
    }
}
```
- The above code simulates the `takeEvery()` in all manners except one thing. See, take every spawns a saga a.k.a a thread to run the `basicSagaFunction()` as seen in the first example. This means it is a non-blocking execution - meaning, the js code will not pause for anything else. But `take` doesn't spawn any threads - this means if there is a delay, then the code will be blocked and held until the delay is resolved.
- This delay can be anything from simple timeout to api fetch call.

```js
import { take, delay } from "redux-saga/effects";

import ActionTypes from "./action.types";

export function* basicSaga() {
    
    while(true) {
        const payload = yield take(ActionTypes.BASIC_ACTION); // returns the payload as value.

        // do some action.
        console.log("Running take() saga like takeEvery()");
        yield delay(5000); // delaying 5000ms. This will stop this saga from listening and wait until the 5000ms delay is resolved - this is because take() doesn't spawn any thread and is a blocking execution. We may need this kind of functionality sometimes.
    }
}
```

#### takeLatest() effect.
- This is similar to `takeEvery()` except this will cancel all the previously running instances of the same saga and only runs the latest saga always. In this way, we can debounce multiple action calls and avoid cluttering the JS app with unnecessary threads.
- This is a ideal function for API calls to use to handle situations where the user clicks multiple times to fetch the same data. With `takeLatest()` function, redux-saga can cancel all the redundant calls and only execute the latest click/call.
- This is the main effect and the most important part of redux-saga. We will use this effect a lot of time.

### Call multiple sagas parallely.
- There is a function called `all()` from `redux-saga/effects`. This can help us get run multiple sagas neatly in a parallel manner.
- To set this up - create a file `root.saga.js` near the root reducer js file area and import all ur saga actions there. Then, create a default saga that yield the `all()` function as such:
```js
import { all, call } from "redux-saga/effects";

// Add all sagas here
import { fetchShopItemsStart } from "./shop/shop.sagas";

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([call(fetchShopItemsStart)]);
}
```
- Thats all. Its quite ezzz.
- Now, import this `rootSaga()` saga into the store.js and run it in our `sagaMiddleware` we made using the `sagaMiddleware.run()` function as follows:
```js
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
```
- we can avoid the all and just yield all our sagas in the `rootSaga()` function - but it will execute all the sagas in a blocking manner - a.k.a sequential manner.
- To run all the sagas parallel in a non-blocking manner - then we yield with the `all()` function.
